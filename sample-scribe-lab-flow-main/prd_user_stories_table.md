| #  | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------------|---------------------|
| 1  | As a lab technician, I want to add weight measurements to samples so that I can calculate concentrations. | - User can input weight for a sample.<br>- Concentration is automatically calculated when weight and volume are present.<br>- Weight changes are saved and reflected in the UI. |
| 2  | As a lab technician, I want to track sample volumes using a digital pipette simulation so that I can manage sample quantities accurately. | - User can adjust sample volume via pipette simulation.<br>- Volume changes are saved and reflected in the UI.<br>- Volume cannot be set below zero. |
| 3  | As a lab technician, I want to transfer specific volumes between sample tubes so that I can prepare samples for different analyses. | - User can select source and destination samples.<br>- User can specify transfer volume.<br>- Volumes are updated for both samples after transfer.<br>- Transfer is logged in sample history. |
| 4  | As a lab technician, I want to split samples into aliquots with different or equal volumes so that I can prepare samples for various tests. | - User can split a sample into multiple aliquots.<br>- User can specify custom or equal volumes.<br>- New aliquots are created and shown in the UI.<br>- Parent-child relationships are maintained. |
| 5  | As a lab technician, I want to merge samples with volume and concentration control so that I can create precise mixed samples. | - User can select samples to merge.<br>- User can specify merge volumes.<br>- Resulting sample has correct volume and concentration.<br>- Merge is logged in sample history. |
| 6  | As a lab technician, I want to generate HPLC sequences from selected samples so that I can run automated analyses. | - User can select samples for HPLC.<br>- Sequence is generated and displayed.<br>- Sequence can be exported as CSV.<br>- Positions are assigned automatically. |
| 7  | As a lab technician, I want sample selection to be synchronized between tracker and history views so that I can easily manage sample groups. | - Selecting samples in one view updates selection in the other.<br>- Selection state is consistent across views. |
| 8  | As a lab technician, I want to see the complete history and relationships of my samples so that I can track sample lineage. | - User can view sample history as a tree or graph.<br>- All parent-child and merge/split relationships are visualized.<br>- UI supports expanding/collapsing history. |
| 9  | As a lab technician, I want to scan barcodes to quickly add samples so that I can efficiently track new samples. | - User can scan a barcode to add a sample.<br>- Barcode is validated for uniqueness.<br>- Sample is created and shown in the UI. |
| 10 | As a lab technician, I want to search and filter samples by various criteria so that I can quickly find specific samples. | - User can search by barcode, name, or properties.<br>- User can filter by status, date, or concentration.<br>- Filtered results are displayed instantly. |
| 11 | As a lab technician, I want to perform batch operations on multiple samples so that I can efficiently manage large sample sets. | - User can select multiple samples.<br>- Batch actions (status update, volume adjustment, transfer, export) are available.<br>- Changes are applied to all selected samples. |
| 12 | As a lab technician, I want to add volume from a source sample with automatic concentration calculations so that I can work with pre-liquids and dilutions. | - User can add volume from one sample to another.<br>- Concentration is recalculated automatically.<br>- Operation is logged in sample history. |
| 13 | As a lab technician, I want to save and load workflows as YAML files so that I can reproduce experimental procedures. | - User can export current workflow as YAML.<br>- User can import workflow from YAML.<br>- Imported workflow is loaded and ready to run. |
| 14 | As a lab technician, I want workflow management options at the beginning of my session so that I can easily start, continue, or load workflows. | - User is prompted to start, continue, or load a workflow at session start.<br>- Selected workflow is loaded and session begins. |
| 15 | As a lab technician, I want to reproduce loaded workflows through a guided interface so that I can follow experimental procedures step by step. | - User is guided through workflow steps.<br>- Progress is tracked and displayed.<br>- User can mark steps as complete. |
| 16 | As a lab technician, I want a dedicated page for sample relationship visualization with zoom capabilities so that I can better understand sample dependencies. | - User can open a dedicated visualization page.<br>- Graph supports zoom and pan.<br>- Relationships are color-coded and interactive. |
